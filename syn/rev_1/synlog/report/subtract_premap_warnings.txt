@W: MT529 :"/home/gfa2226/fpga/hw3/motion_detect/fifo.sv":63:4:63:12|Found inferred clock motion_detect_top|clock which controls 399 sequential elements including background.empty. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
